## Indoor Air Quality Challenge and Context

The UK Parliament's report on Indoor Air Quality highlights the critical link between poor indoor air and heightened health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, cognitive impairment, and certain cancers (UK Parliament, 2023). This underscores the significance of addressing indoor air quality concerns, especially considering that individuals spend a significant portion, ranging from 80% to 90%, of their time indoors, encompassing various settings such as homes, workplaces, schools, and transportation.

Poor indoor air quality stems from various sources, including building materials, cooking and heating appliances, consumer products, occupant activities, dampness, and mould, as well as the surrounding environment where buildings are situated. To combat indoor air pollution, multiple strategies can be employed, such as eliminating pollutant sources, enhancing ventilation systems, and employing air purification methods.

However, mitigating indoor air pollution presents challenges due to the trade-off between improving ventilation to enhance air quality and minimizing energy consumption in buildings. Striking a balance is crucial to ensure that indoor air remains at optimal levels without resorting to keeping windows open or operating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems excessively.


*Could ML Help Address This Challenge?*

Supervised machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach in air quality analysis, offering potential solutions to mitigate indoor air quality issues (Essamlali et al., 2024). In particular, two main types of ML models have been instrumental in addressing indoor air quality concerns. Firstly, supervised ML classification models are employed to identify and classify different states of indoor air quality, providing insights into the current condition of the environment. Secondly, regression models play a crucial role in predicting continuous values, such as pollutant levels, by considering various factors such as time, location, and weather conditions. These ML techniques offer valuable tools for understanding and managing indoor air quality, paving the way for more effective strategies to ensure healthier indoor environments.


## Application overview and research question development

*Application Overview*

Given the aforementioned challenge, the primary goal off this project is to explore benefits and challenges of real-time classification of indoor air quality and determine if they are caused by activities that are taking place indoors. The project aims to discern various states of indoor air quality by leveraging sensor data collected from embedded devices and supervised machine learning. 

The expectation would be that by employing machine learning algorithms directly on the edge, accurate insights into indoor air quality conditions could offer a practical and efficient solution for monitoring and managing indoor environments wihtout having to trade off the energy efficiency.


## Application Overview
Thinking back to the various application diagrams you have seen through the module - how would you describe an overview of the building blocks of your project - how do they connect, what do the component parts include.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to convey your design!*

## Data
Describe what data sources you have used and any cleaning, wrangling or organising you have done. Including some examples of the data helps others understand what you have been working with.

*Tip: probably ~200 words and images of what the data 'looks like' are good!*

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
